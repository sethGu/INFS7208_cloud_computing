# INFS7208_cloud_computing

## This is the assignments of Cloud Computing course in University of Queensland
The course code is INFS7208, which I think is the same as the INFS3208?

* The Assignment 2
* * about creating a docker-compose.yml to quick migration/release the project,
* * I think it should be DevOps stuff?

* The Assignment 3
* * about using spark to do something word frequency stuff,
* * I think it is a simplier version of INFS7410, with the use of Scala and spark RDD.
* * I will release it after I get the master's graduation certificate (althought it is a very easy assignment).

* The individual project
* * about using ml-spark to do something interesting.
* * Here in year 2020 sem2, there are 2 types of choices, which is playing with a simple full-stack project or play with ml-spark, I choose the latter even I have finished INFS7202 (because I think turning front-end and back-end stuff is very tiresome).
* * I will release it after I get the master's graduation certificate (althought it is a very easy assignment).
